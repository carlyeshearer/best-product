# best-product
The Best Product application will be used by everyday shoppers who wish to find the product that best fits their needs. 
The application allows users to input items and create several lists to compare items based on different criteria such as name, price, quality, and availability. 
The software will be used anywhere when a person wants to compare prices for items. 
Users will want to use this software over existing processes because it compares items on multiple criteria in a simple, readable format. 
It also allows them to assign a personal rating to an item if they have purchased it.

The Best Product application has been updated to include a LinkedList structure instead of an ArrayList structure to store a user’s items. This change was implemented to allow the list to be accessed forwards and backwards while maintaining the insertion order of the items. A new method has been added to allow the user to search for an item. This method uses a map with a key of the item’s name and the item as the value. The method returns the item associated with the name key in the map. The UML diagram has been updated to reflect these changes.
