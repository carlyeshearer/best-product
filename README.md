# best-product
The Best Product application will be used by everyday shoppers who wish to find the product that best fits their needs. 
The application allows users to input items and create several lists to compare items based on different criteria such as name, price, quality, and availability. 
The software will be used anywhere when a person wants to compare prices for items. 
Users will want to use this software over existing processes because it compares items on multiple criteria in a simple, readable format. 
It also allows them to assign a personal rating to an item if they have purchased it.
